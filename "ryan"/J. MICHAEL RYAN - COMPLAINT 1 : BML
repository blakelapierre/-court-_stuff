    Complaint:  Violations of 18 U.S.C. Section 241 & 242 w/ kidnapping
    ----------


    On the record, J. Michael Ryan admitted to an ex parte hearing; at the hearing my right to due process was violated and not preserved. This eventually resulted in me being kidnapped, apparently at his direction.




    The Undersigned hereby certifies to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
    that the statements in the foregoing Complaint are true and correct to
    the best of my knowledge.
